<p>As part of the earthquake process, Earth&rsquo;s surface is being deformed as
  earthquake faults accumulate strain and slip or slowly creep over time. We
  use GPS to monitor this movement by measuring the precise position (within
  5mm or less) of stations near active faults relative to each other. Months
  or years later, we occupy the same stations again. By determining how the
  stations have moved we calculate ground deformation.

  <h2>Cooperators</h2>
  <p>The USGS Earthquake Hazards Program (EHP) supports GPS data collection
    throughout the western U.S. through cooperative agreements with Central
    Washington University, University of California at Berkeley, University of
    Memphis, and University of Nevada at Reno. We process GPS data that we
    collect, as well as data from the USGS Volcano Hazards Program (VHP), our
    cooperator institutions, UNAVCO Inc., and other sources (see a
    <a href="gps/sources.php">full listing of observing agencies</a>). These
    results are available on this website as time series of daily GPS positions.</p>
